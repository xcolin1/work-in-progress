							In truth dying on mars is actually quite easy. Whether it be by freeze to death,
							suffocation, radiation exposure, an asteroid, pick your poison. But dying is an
							inevitability, but living is the question, what are the barriers to life on our red
							neighbor? Are they surmountable today or will they be in the future? One of the major issues
							of living on Mars is the need for water<i class="bi bi-droplet"></i>. Scientist have found
							some indications of Ice on the planetâ€™s surface, though most is thought to be CO2, but some
							is thought to be possibly water though far too salty to drink. But we could possibly make it
							useable. The question now is how much is accessible and what will the process be to make it
							of use?</figcaption><br>

						<figcaption>The next issue is oxygen, that in theory has been solved. <span
								class="text-success">NASA was able to make breathable air from the atmosphere during
								their test using instruments on the Perseverance rover.</span> This bodes well, not only
							for Mars but for other potential planets, and moon as well.</figcaption>

						<figcaption>Now that we gotten breathing and fuel (both eating and energy) out of the way, we
							must talk about the environment. Mars in general is a hospitable place, it has temperature
							that range from -220 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit, with an average of -81. Not good habitable
							for more than a few species on earth. With a lack of a rotating core this is not going to
							change anytime soon. Without a core to create a magnetic field to protect the planet from
							solar winds, there will be no remaking of the Martian atmosphere, therefore most likely
							never a day where we will be strolling suit less on the planet at all.</figcaption>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<figcaption>Therefore our best bet would be to create underground habitats that are far enough
							down to shield us from storm planetary and extra planetary. Then comes gravity and
							atmospheric pressure. We do not know if we as humans can give birth or live in these Martian
							conditions. How will the lack of gravity and pressure affect our hearts, bones, muscles, and
							brains? Can a Martian ever come back to earth?
							These are just a few issues that I believe will be keeping us from ever being able to
							sustain a human life on mars. There are probably many more, but I am not an Bio astrologist.
